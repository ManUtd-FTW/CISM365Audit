# CISM365Audit

Minimal PowerShell module to audit a Microsoft 365 tenant against a subset of the **CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark (v5.0.0.3)** and produce a simple HTML report.

> **Status:** v0.0.7 (latest)

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Lightweight PowerShell module structure (`.psd1`, `.psm1`, `Public/`, `Private/`).
- Single entrypoint: `Start-CISM365Audit`.
- Self-contained connection checks (Microsoft Graph + Exchange Online).
- **Updated report layout** for improved readability and summary.
- Minimal HTML report with PASS / FAIL / MANUAL / ERROR states.

## ‚úÖ Controls Implemented (v0.0.7)
- Existing controls:
  - **1.1.3** ‚Äì Ensure that between two and four Global Admins are designated (via Microsoft Graph; counts users including group membership).
  - **2.1.9** ‚Äì Ensure that DKIM is enabled for all Exchange Online domains (custom authoritative domains only).
  - **2.1.1** ‚Äì Ensure Safe Links for Office applications is enabled (reads `Get-AtpPolicyForO365`).
- **New controls added in v0.0.7:**
    - **2.2.x** ‚Äì 
    - **3.1.x** ‚Äì

## üì¶ Requirements
- **PowerShell**: Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+
- **Modules** (install if missing):
  ```powershell
  Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
  Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement -Scope CurrentUser
  ```
- **Permissions**:
  - Microsoft Graph: `Directory.Read.All` (delegated) when prompted.
  - Exchange Online: Ability to connect and read org settings (e.g., Security Reader/Global Reader or EXO role with equivalent rights).

> Tip: The module will attempt to connect interactively if required permissions/sessions are not already present.

## üîß Install (Local)
Clone or download the repo, then import the module from the project root:

```powershell
# From the repo root
Import-Module .\CISM365Audit.psd1 -Force
# or
Import-Module .\CISM365Audit.psm1 -Force
```

> You can also copy the entire folder into one of your `$env:PSModulePath` locations to import by name.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start
Run an audit for your tenant (use your tenant's initial domain like `contoso.onmicrosoft.com` or your vanity domain where applicable):

```powershell
Start-CISM365Audit -Tenant "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
```

This generates `CISM365AuditReport.html` in the working directory.

---

## üìö Usage Examples
### 1) Basic audit with default output
```powershell
Start-CISM365Audit -Tenant "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
```

### 2) Custom output path
```powershell
Start-CISM365Audit -Tenant "contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -OutputPath ".\Reports\report.html"
```

### 3) Verbose logging (helpful for connection and control flow)
```powershell
$VerbosePreference = 'Continue'
Start-CISM365Audit -Tenant "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
$VerbosePreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
```

### 4) (Optional) Pre-connect to services
If your module version exports `Connect-CISM365Services`, you can connect up-front and then run the audit:
```powershell
# Connect to Microsoft Graph & Exchange Online (interactive)
Connect-CISM365Services -Scopes 'Directory.Read.All' -Organization "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"

# Run the audit
Start-CISM365Audit -Tenant "contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -OutputPath .\CISM365AuditReport.html
```
> If `Connect-CISM365Services` is not exported in your build, `Start-CISM365Audit` will still attempt to connect as needed.

## üßæ Output
- **HTML report** (default: `CISM365AuditReport.html`) with a summary and a table of controls:
  - **PASS** ‚Äì The control meets the benchmark requirement.
  - **FAIL** ‚Äì The control does not meet the requirement.
  - **MANUAL** ‚Äì Requires manual review or information not available via API/cmdlet.
  - **ERROR** ‚Äì An exception occurred while evaluating the control.
- **New in v0.0.7:** Updated layout for clearer summaries, improved styling, and enhanced readability.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Missing modules**: Install required modules (see Requirements) and re-import the module.
- **Graph consent**: First-time Graph sign-in may require admin consent for `Directory.Read.All`.
- **EXO connection**: If `Get-ConnectionInformation` shows not connected, run `Connect-ExchangeOnline -Organization <tenant>` and retry.
- **Permissions**: Use an account with at least **Global Reader/Security Reader** for tenant-wide reads.

---

## üß≠ Roadmap (Next)
- Further improvements to HTML styling (summary badges, consistent colors, better layout).
- Expand control coverage (additional CIS v3.0.0 items, then v5 mapping).
- Optional: Export `Connect-CISM365Services` and add `Disconnect-CISM365Services`.
- Optional: App-only authentication for CI/CD.
